        <img src="assets/WHAT IS ‘GOTH’.png">
        <p>Not emo. What’s up with you kids these days thinking everything’s emo? I swear the ignorance these days is
            tragic. Well it NOT. It’s also not an ‘aesthetic’, it’s a cult(ure). Goth came from the ruins of punk, but
            make
            it more apocalyptic—spookier, if you will. The music? Oh, the music—soaked in gloom, cryptic lyrics, and a
            touch
            of the end times. It’s like if punk had a younger sister who reads the poetry in graveyards.</p>
        <p>‘If they’re not emo why do they wear black’, it symbolizes lots of common themes. Goth culture is built and
            thrives on themes of death, darkness, and everything your humans pretends doesn’t exist.</p>
