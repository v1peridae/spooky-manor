        <p>Let me break it to you gently: you can’t just decide to be goth. Goth isn’t some hobby, it has to find you.
            But aye, I’ll throw you a bone, just to see if the goth gods might notice you.<br><br>
            First things first, start with the music. If you don’t like it well... you’re doomed, but haven’t you always
            been? Lucky for you, I’ve got <a href="gothmusic.html">my list of top goth bands and artists</a>. You’re
            welcome.<br><br>
            You don’t only have to listen to gothic music all the time. Yes, you can still bump Lady Gaga or whatever
            you kids listen to these days.<br><br>
            Oh, and get this —you don’t even have to dress up goth. I know, I know, the absolute scandal! I’ll probably
            get hate
            for this, but the truth is, looking goth isn’t a requirement. No one’s going to revoke your goth card,
            trust. </p><br><br>
