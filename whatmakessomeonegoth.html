        <p>Back when I had flesh and bones it was the music that made you goth; not
            the piercings or the black lipstick. It’s all about the eerie, melancholic sounds. You could wrap yourself
            in velvet and lace all you want, but if you
            don't feel the music deep in your empty soul, you're just cosplaying love.
            I hate to gatekeep but, real goths aren’t shein warriors either. You really think
            any goth would support that unsustainable nonsense? True goths value
            authenticity —and that includes making sure their wardrobe doesn’t destroy the planet in the process, thank
            you very much. <br><br>Also, despite their very ominous appearance, goths are actually some of the nicest
            creatures
            you’ll
            ever meet. As mysterious as the music may be, their personalities are... well, pretty much the opposite.
            While you might expect them to curse your existence (which, to be fair, you probably
            deserve), they’ll likely be too busy being decent human beings.
